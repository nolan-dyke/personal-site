                Welcome to my powder blue corner of the internet.
                I'm a full stack web developer, traveler, and nerd 
                based in Denver, CO.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm an avid learner and lover of beautiful design. My
                passions have taken me from studying biochemistry and molecular biology 
                to teaching English in Taiwan & China to developing useful 
                and beautiful web apps. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a zeal for diving into new technologies, a 
                drive to improve the code that I write, and I care
                deeply about using my skills to make a positive 
                impact.
            </p>
